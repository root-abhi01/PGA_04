      " [21] 574,Some background on this: C++ supports multiple inheritance  but C# does not. Multiple inheritance in C++ has always be controversial  because the resolution of multiple inherited implementations of the same method from different base classes is hard to control and anticipate. C# decided to avoid this problem by allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces  which do not contain method implementations  but restricting a class to have at most a single parent class. Although this can result in redundant implementations of the same method when different classes implement the same interface  it is still an excellent compromise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

      " [65] 2416,The interview was quite easy. Most of the questions were from academic project  3 questions were from oops. He also asked me sql concepts like joins  normalization  triggering  indexing. As he is oracle team lead most of the questions he asked me from oracle that I was unable to answer and I just said that I don't have much knowledge in this. He also asked me to write a program to merge two strings. At the end he asked me to rate myself in java as well as oracle. After that he told many things about wipro when I asked him. My technical interview continued for about 35 minutes after an hour results were declared and I cleared my technical round. After that we were asked to leave for home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

      " [67] 256,\"Generally for any interviews we might have heard of having group discussions on general topics but for LG Soft it is completely different. They will give you a technical topic and would divide the crowd into 2 groups. They will give 10 minutes for one group to support their concept and in the same way other group too! What I felt was that it was more like a debate than a discussion. In this round they will not assess our Communication skills or Management Skills rather they would specifically analyze our technical knowledge. For us the topic was \"\"Procedural Oriented Vs Object Oriented\"\". I initially  thought that it was an easy topic to discuss but as it is a competition we will not easily get chance to express and support our words. Somehow I tried to convey the things that I know and actively participated in the discussion. After 10 minutes they will change the positions of the 2 groups and would ask you to speak. Now  we should be very careful. We should not repeat the points that were already mentioned by some other people.

      " [94] 571,Abstract classes are closely related to interfaces. They are classes that cannot be instantiated  and are frequently either partially implemented  or not at all implemented. One key difference between abstract classes and interfaces is that a class may implement an unlimited number of interfaces  but may inherit from only one abstract (or any other kind of) class. A class that is derived from an abstract class may still implement interfaces. Abstract classes are useful when creating components because they allow you specify an invariant level of functionality in some methods  but leave the implementation of other methods until a specific implementation of that class is needed.

      "[101] 1262,We had to go to Polaris company for interview which is located in Gachibowli  firstly I was shocked to see the campus because its my first MNC which I've entered into. Even security guards room was equipped with AC  that amazes me very much. After some time we've entered into the office  they served us with snacks. The interview in polaris is quite different from others  they will ask you different situations and asks what will you do in that situation and how will you react it  all of them says real life problems  it lasts for 25-30 mins. I was lucky the interviewer is very much friendly to me.

      "[164] 1194,Maintaining genetic diversity is crucial for the long-term survival of any crop. When a crop variety somewhere becomes vulnerable either due to the onslaught of a disease or the soil becoming waterlogged or alkaline  scientists need to breed another variety of the crop for that region. They do this by searching for suitable genes in related varieties and the natural gene pool of rice and introduce harmful features like gene-silencing or change the normal functions of other genes  it would have terrible implications for food security of the rice-eating regions of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "[172] 1822,A) The number on the overview screen corresponds to the total of LUWs (see  also first question) that were written to the qRFC queue and that have not yet  been confirmed. The detail screen displays the records contained in the LUWs.  Both  the records belonging to the previous delta request and the records that  do not meet the selection conditions of the preceding delta init requests are  filtered out. Thus  only the records that are ready for the next delta request  are displayed on the detail screen.

      "[201] 1072,In unmanaged environments the compiler and linker directly compile the source code in to native instructions that are targeted at a specific processor. The disadvantage of this process is that each time you want to run your executable on a different platform you will have to re-compile the code using a compiler and linker that will compile the code that is targeted at the specific hardware. This means that each time you want your application to run on a different platform  you will have to ship the compiled instructions again and again. As this leads to compiling and maintaining multiple versions of the same application  the companies try to create a more generalized compiled version in order to target most of the environments. This process is known as the Lowest Common Denominator approach. This leads to a more generalized program which is not optimized properly and does not take advantages of the underlying hardware infrastructure (processor  cache  etc). Because the CLR supplies one or more Just in Time Compiler for each computer architecture it supports  the same set of MSIL can be JIT-compiled and run on any supported architecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

      "[206] 1080,Imagine this scenario: I/O completion ports are communictaions ports which take handles to files  sockets  or any other I/O. When a Read or Write is submitted to them  they cache the data (if necessary)  and attempt to take the request to completion. Upon error or completion  they call a user-supplied function to let the users application know that that particular request has completed. They work asynchronously  and can process an unlimited number of simultaneous requests. Design the implementation and thread models for I/O completion ports. Remember to take into account multi-processor machines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

      "[238] 337,A property clause is a named object that contains a list of properties and their settings. Once you create a property clause you can base other object on it.

      "[285] 356,Referencing allows you to create objects that inherit their functionality and appearance from other objects.

A reference object automatically inherits any changes that have been made to the source object when you open or regenerate the module that contains the reference object.

      "[292] 577,An interface is not a class. It is an entity that is defined by the word Interface. An interface has no implementation; it only has the signature or in other words  just the definition of the methods without the body. As one of the similarities to Abstract class  it is a contract that is used to define hierarchies for all subclasses or it defines specific set of methods and their arguments. The main difference between them is that a class can implement more than one interface but can only inherit from one abstract class. Since C# doesn?t support multiple inheritance  interfaces are used to implement multiple inheritance.What is serialization  how it works in .NET?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

      "[325] 1557,This was my key to crack this round. If you try and solve quantitative first you invest a lot of time in that and plus it is a bit harder to solve and you do not get the answer easily  then you start worrying  lose more time  more panics  your brain gets stuck and then you cannot even attempt the rest 2 sections with a stable mind and make them wrong too. They give the quantitative section first  but you can navigate to the other section easily and start solving that first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Once you marked the answer before 2.15 minutes the answer will be automatically saved. If you click on NEXT option on the screen before 2.15 minutes then it will display you the next question and if you don't wish to do so then you have a buffer time of 30 seconds after which the next question will be displayed so you can feel relaxed for a moment(DO NOT FOLLOW THIS FOR EVERY QUESTION).  This helped me personally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Theif will unlock the door without exact key. and if that thief is given a chance to prepare the lock and key  he will do it perfectly in such a way that  no other theif can unlock it. Just like that if a tester comes to development and writes a code  the code will be in such a way that no other tester can find any bugs in it.

After 2 minutes of brainstorming about the topic monitor asked us to start the discussion  one of my friend took initiative and started the discussion I was really waiting for chance as soon as she completed almost 3 to 4 members of my friends started arguing  being as a girl I don't have a loud voice  I was really disappointed that why am I not delivering even though I have valid points 3 minutes passed away discussion turned out very clumsy and I didn't even speak for once I was actually broken that  everyone was shouting as it is very easy topic panel member was really annoyed with our discussion after few seconds I realized one thing and shouted as much as I can \"\"GUYS  THIS IS A GROUP DISCUSSION NOT A DEBATE\"\" everyone was so calm monitor was bit happy and again they started shouting as we are running out of time I concluded the discussion. After 6 minutes of discussion everyone are supposed to give self introduction and speak 1 min of their own topic individually. On the spot he announced the result 9 members got selected for technical HR and I was one among them. Key point to remember to clear GD is Be confident  speak authoritatively and politely  must and make an eye contact with your friends. These are enough to clear GD.\"\n",

(The table name created will be MLOGS_tablename  and trigger name will be TLOGS name).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

      "[487] 413,\"PL/SQL V2.2  available with Oracle7.2  implements a binary wrapper for PL/SQL programs to protect the source code. This is done via a standalone utility that transforms the PL/SQL source code into portable binary object code (somewhat larger than the original). This way you can distribute software without having to worry about exposing your proprietary algorithms and methods. SQL*Plus and SQL*DBA will still understand and know how to execute such scripts.

      "[497] 1689,Answer 10: (Moment he said this mind was like ok dude I'm Leaving. I stared at them with blank eyes.) They said do you need a moment? I said yes sir  that will be great. Actually this is my first interviewed and i'm very nervous  I didn't sit for any interview during my graduation. They asked why so? I started to answer but couldn't phrase words correctly and I apologised. They said there was nothing to apologise for and that it was quite natural. Somehow managed to say that back then i wasn't ready for an interview as i didn't have enough knowledge and that things would have been more worse than this(pointing to the blank paper). Then I looked at the formula again and couldn't even figure out how I would store the actual values and the measured ones. I confessed this by saying  Sir My mind if totally blank and I can't even think of how I'm supposed to store all the values. He then helped me by reminding me of arrays. I then somehow coded it in c which was incorrect and he pointed that out.  Then asked me to code the same incorrect one in Python but with proper syntax  which I managed somehow. Then asked if dictionaries are more useful for this scenario as we could keep the values as key and their error as values.
